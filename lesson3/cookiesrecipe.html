    <h1>Aglio olio By Assya</h1>
    <div class="glass">
<p> Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, but even these are optional. In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. </p>

<h3>Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper</li>

<h3>How to make spaghettie aglio olio</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water before you drain it!</li>
<li>Next, toast the garlic and red pepper flakes. Heat the oil in a large skillet and add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned around the edges.</li>
<li>Then, add the kale. Toss it with the garlic oil and cook until it wilts.</li>
<li>Finally, stir in the pasta, along with the lemon juice and zest and a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss to combine, adding more pasta water, as needed, to create a light sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. That’s it!
